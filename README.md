# Walmart-Business-Case-Study

# ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer purchase behavior, with a specific focus on purchase amounts, in relation to customer gender during the Black Friday sales event at Walmart Inc. This study aims to provide valuable insights that can assist Walmart Inc.'s management team in making data-driven decisions.

# About the Data
The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday.It has information of about 0.5 Million transactions during Black Friday throughout various years.

# Business Recommendations
* To boost sales, the company should devise gender-specific strategies, acknowledging that men typically exhibit higher spending habits. However, it's imperative to cater to female customers as well, offering them discounts and special deals to ensure inclusivity.
* With the 51-55 age group displaying higher purchasing power, diverting additional resources towards attracting customers from other age demographics becomes imperative.
* Certain product categories, notably 19, 20, and 13, register minimal sales activity. Considering discontinuing these categories could streamline inventory management and resource allocation, thus optimizing overall operations.
* Furthermore, the analysis highlights a substantial volume of purchase orders falling within the 5k to 10k price range. Emphasizing the promotion and improvement of products within this mid-range price segment has the potential to drive increased sales and revenue.
